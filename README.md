# Applied-Bayesian-Inference

This is the repo in accordance with these two Medium articles:
1. [Applied Bayesian Inference with Python pt.1](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-bayesian-inference-pt-1-322b25093f62)
2. [Applied Bayesian Inference with Python pt.2](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-bayesian-inference-with-python-pt-2-80bcd63b507e)

In part 1, I introduce modeling the conditional world via Python/PyMC3 from a contrived coin flip example. In part 2, I dive deeper into Bayesian Analysis with a dataset from Kaggle. Adidas vs Nike sales dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kaushiksuresh147/adidas-vs-nike
